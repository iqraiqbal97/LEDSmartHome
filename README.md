# LEDSmartHome
Developed a software to enhance the control for physically challenged individuals in a SMART home environment. 

The purpose of this project was to create an autonomous house environment to enhance a disabled individual. The aim was achieved through using an EEG headset to turn a phidgets kit LED light on or off. The outcome was successful as it included 3 different aspects to improve the user experience. Firstly; the programme which consisted of the initial function of the light change, a training exercise for the user to grasp the concept of using an ECG headset and an android mobile application.  An API was also built that included the basic functions and methods.
